ZL - Zwizwa Lib

Date: Fri Oct 11 19:07:16 EDT 2013

This is a grab bag of "old tech" plain C objects without any bindings
or fancy dependencies.  It is a shared pool of objects used in pdp[1]
and libprim[2].  

Code is duplicated in those projects, and available as a stand-alone
archive here[3].

License is defaulted to GPL, but drop me a line if you need something
else.  Note that some objects are stuck at GPL due to multiple
contributors.

Unmarked code is (c) 2003-2013 Tom Schouten <tom@zwizwa.be>
Other authors are mentioned in the specific files.

Some of these objects are from libprim and have stubbed-out code for
the LEAF base object library.
